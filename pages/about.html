  <p>My name is <b>Seth Holland</b>.</p>

  <p>
    I am software developer with about a dozen years of professional experience.
    At my job, I use mostly .NET and C# to develop and maintain web and desktop applications,
    as well as many backend services and reports.
    I also make extensive use of SQL.
  </p>

  <p>
    I use Windows all day at work, but at home I have a frankly <i>incredible</i> Arch Linux setup.
    On this site, I want to share some of the cool scripts I've developed and some of the side projects
    I've worked on. I will also, from time to time, give my opinion on the state of the software industry.
    I also just want to share some neat stuff that I like.
  </p>

  <p>
    My hobbies include lifting weights, playing piano, singing, walking around my neighborhood, and playing pickleball.
